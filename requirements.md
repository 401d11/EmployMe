## Vision
EmployeMee is the premier recruiting website designed to streamline and modernize the hiring process for business looking for qualified employees. EmployMee stores a database of potential employees that hiring business can filter, review, and ultimately notify the other party for job offers. EmployMee is useful for both users that sign up for the website looking for job opportunities and businesses that are looking to offer specific opportunities for qualified individuals rather than sifting through a pile of resumes.

## Scope
Features:
- A signup for both business and candidates.
- A discovery page that business can use to filter the candidates based on certain skills.
- A method for businesses to "notify" the candidate that they are interested in contacting them for a job opportunity.
- A profile page businesses to keep track of which candidates they are interested in.
- A profile page for candidates to display their information, skills, resume, etc.

### MVP
A website that allows businesses and individuals to sign up and login. Individuals will have a profile page to display their info. Businesses will be able to hit a button and add individuals to their "interested/contact" list. Presumably, the EmployMee company would then notify the individual about their prospective job opportunity, job info, interviews, etc.
### Stretch Goals
Individuals can update their profile/resume/profile image.
Businesses can remove individuals that are no longer interested in the job.
